	abstract ={More than US$21 billion is spent annually on biodiversity conservation. Despite their importance for preventing or slowing extinctions and preserving biodiversity, conservation interventions are rarely assessed systematically for their global impact. Islands house a disproportionately higher amount of biodiversity compared with mainlands, much of which is highly threatened with extinction. Indeed, island species make up nearly two-thirds of recent extinctions. Islands therefore are critical targets of conservation. We used an extensive literature and database review paired with expert interviews to estimate the global benefits of an increasingly used conservation action to stem biodiversity loss: eradication of invasive mammals on islands. We found 236 native terrestrial insular faunal species (596 populations) that benefitted through positive demographic and/or distributional responses from 251 eradications of invasive mammals on 181 islands. Seven native species (eight populations) were negatively impacted by invasive mammal eradication. Four threatened species had their International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List extinction-risk categories reduced as a direct result of invasive mammal eradication, and no species moved to a higher extinction-risk category. We predict that 107 highly threatened birds, mammals, and reptiles on the IUCN Red List—6% of all these highly threatened species—likely have benefitted from invasive mammal eradications on islands. Because monitoring of eradication outcomes is sporadic and limited, the impacts of global eradications are likely greater than we report here. Our results highlight the importance of invasive mammal eradication on islands for protecting the world's most imperiled fauna.},

Although coastal wetlands have long been considered vulnerable to sea-level rise, recent work has identified fascinating feedbacks between plant growth and geomorphology that allow wetlands to actively resist the deleterious effects of sea-level rise. Humans alter the strength of these feedbacks by changing the climate, nutrient inputs, sediment delivery and subsidence rates. Whether wetlands continue to survive sea-level rise depends largely on how human impacts interact with rapid sea-level rise, and socio-economic factors that influence transgression into adjacent uplands.},

@article{Ramsey2009,
abstract = {A major challenge facing pest-eradication efforts is determining
when eradication has been achieved. When the pest can no longer be detected,
managers have to decide whether the pest has actually been eliminated and hence
to decide when to terminate the eradication program. For most eradication
programs, this decision entails considerable risk and is the largest single
issue facing managers of such programs. We addressed this issue for an
eradication program of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) from Santa Cruz Island,
California. Using a Bayesian approach, we estimated the degree of confidence in
the success of the eradication program at the point when monitoring failed to
detect any more pigs. Catch-effort modeling of the hunting effort required to
dispatch pigs during the eradication program was used to determine the
relationship between detection probability and searching effort for different
hunting methods. We then used these relationships to estimate the amount of
monitoring effort required to declare eradication successful with criteria that
either set a threshold for the probability that pigs remained undetected (type I
error) or minimized the net expected costs of the eradication program (cost of
type I and II errors). For aerial and ground-based monitoring techniques, the
amount of search effort required to declare eradication successful on the basis
of either criterion was highly dependent on the prior belief in the success of
the program unless monitoring intensities exceeded 30 km of searching effort per
square kilometer of search area for aerial monitoring and, equivalently, 38 km
for ground monitoring. Calculation of these criteria to gauge the success of
eradication should form an essential component of any eradication program as it
allows for a transparent assessment of the risks inherent in the decision to
terminate the program.},

	abstract = {More than 18 million seabirds nest on 58 Pacific islands protected within vast U.S. Marine National Monuments (1.9 million km2). However, most of these seabird colonies are on low-elevation islands and sea-level rise (SLR) and accompanying high-water perturbations are predicted to escalate with climate change. To understand how SLR may impact protected islands and insular biodiversity, we modeled inundation and wave-driven flooding of a globally important seabird rookery in the subtropical Pacific. We acquired new high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and used the Delft3D wave model and ArcGIS to model wave heights and inundation for a range of SLR scenarios (+0.5, +1.0, +1.5, and +2.0 m) at Midway Atoll. Next, we classified vegetation to delineate habitat exposure to inundation and identified how breeding phenology, colony synchrony, and life history traits affect species-specific sensitivity. We identified 3 of 13 species as highly vulnerable to SLR in the Hawaiian Islands and quantified their atoll-wide distribution (Laysan albatross, Phoebastria immutabilis; black-footed albatross, P. nigripes; and Bonin petrel, Pterodroma hypoleuca). Our models of wave-driven flooding forecast nest losses up to 10\% greater than passive inundation models at +1.0 m SLR. At projections of + 2.0 m SLR, approximately 60\% of albatross and 44\% of Bonin petrel nests were overwashed displacing more than 616,400 breeding albatrosses and petrels. Habitat loss due to passive SLR may decrease the carrying capacity of some islands to support seabird colonies, while sudden high-water events directly reduce survival and reproduction. This is the first study to simulate wave-driven flooding and the combined impacts of SLR, groundwater rise, and storm waves on seabird colonies. Our results highlight the need for early climate change planning and restoration of higher elevation seabird refugia to prevent low-lying protected islands from becoming ecological traps in the face of rising sea levels.},
