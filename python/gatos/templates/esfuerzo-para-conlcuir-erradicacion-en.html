<!--Effort required to complete eradication-->
<p>
    The effort required to complete the eradication is between 27,000 and 60,000 trap-
    nights. This estimation is obtained from the 95% credibility interval of the
    probability of eradication success (<strong>Figure 3</strong> left). In <strong>Figure 3</strong> (right) we can see how
    the probability of eradication completion increases with effort. The orange line
    indicates that a success probability of 95% is reached around 56 thousand trapnights.

<p>
    We estimate that 56,000 trap&#8729nights are required to eradicate all remaining cats.
    This estimation implies that:
    <ul>
        <li> 187 days (approximately 6 months) are needed if 10 trappers (with 30 traps each) participate.</li>
        <li> The available time remaining in the field for the rest of the year is approximately 100 days. To complete 
            the eradication this year, 19 trappers (with 30 traps each) are required. </li>
    </ul>
